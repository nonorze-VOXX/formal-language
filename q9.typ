9. Let $Sigma = {a_1,...,a_n}$ be an alphabet of $n$ symbols.

  + Construct an `NFA` with $2n + 1$ states accepting the set $L_n$ of strings over $Sigma$ such that, every string in $L_n$ has an odd number of $a_i$, for some $a_i in Sigma$. Equivalently, if $L^i_n$ is the set of strings over $Sigma$ with an odd number of $a_i$, then $L_n = L^1_n union...union L^n_n$.

  + Prove that there is a `DFA` with $2^n$ states accepting the language $L_n$.

  + Prove that every `DFA` accepting $L_n$ has at least $2^n$ states.
